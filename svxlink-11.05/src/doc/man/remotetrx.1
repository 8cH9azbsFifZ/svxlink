.SH NAME
.
remotetrx \- The SvxLink remote transceiver application
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.BI "remotetrx [--help] [--daemon] [--logfile=" "log file" "] [--config=" "configuration file" "] [--pidfile=" "pid file" "] [--runasuser=" "user name" ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B remotetrx
is the SvxLink remote transceiver application. It is used to connect to a
receiver and/or transmitter and then the main SvxLink server can connect to the
remote transceiver server via TCP/IP to get audio to/from it.
.P
It is also possible to link via RF instead of via TCP/IP. An example use of the
latter would be if the repeater is placed in a remote location where there is
no network. Then networked remote receivers can be linked up to the repeater
via RF from a link site where network is available.
.P
The setup is pretty straight forward. The setup of a receiver or transmitter is
done in the same way as in the SvxLink server so use the
.BR svxlink.conf (5)
manual page as a reference for that. The remotetrx specific configuration is
described in the
.BR remotetrx.conf (5)
manual page.
.P
On the SvxLink server side you need to configure a networked
receiver/transmitter. That is described in the
.BR svxlink.conf (5)
manual page in the Networked Receiver/Transmitter Section. If using multiple
receivers you also want to configure a voter and make proper calibration of the
signal level detector on each receiver.
