command  function
0        help
01       available preconfigured airports
1...XX   request METARs from preconfigured airports in order to configuration

You have two search functions for not preconfigured airports to request a METAR 
of an airport of your interest:

1) the svx-like:

20 -> 2
21 -> A
22 -> B
23 -> C
30 -> 3
31 -> D
32 -> E
...
90 -> 9
91 -> W
92 -> X
93 -> Y
94 -> Z

Examples:
EDDP -> 32313171#
KLAX -> 52532192#


2) the star-method:

dtmf on dialpad   digit
2                 -> A
22                -> B
222               -> C
3                 -> D
33                -> E
333               -> F
...
9                 -> W
99                -> X
999               -> Y
9999              -> Z

BTW: a ** repeats the last digit

Examples:
KLAX ->  55*555*2*99#
EDDM ->  33*3**6#
ESSB ->  33*7777**22#
LEPA ->  555*33*7*2#


INSTALL:

- recompile and reinstall the latest trunk of SvxLink
- edit the /etc/svxlink/ModuleMetarInfo.conf as your own needs
- create the directory: /usr/share/svxlink/sounds/MetarInfo and copy the raw-files
  into it
- to activate the module, you also have to add an entry "ModuleMetarInfo" in
  the svxlink.conf, for example:

[SimplexLogic]
...
MODULES=ModuleHelp,ModuleEchoLink,ModuleMetarInfo
...


CONFIGURATION:
In /etc/svxlink.d/ModuleMetarInfo.conf

ID=5
ID-Number of your module, you can activate it by sending 5 and #

TIMEOUT=300
Time in seconds after that the module is deactivated if nothing happens

AIRPORTS=EDDP,EDDV,EDDF,EDDM,KJFK,...
Comma separated list of ICAO shortcuts, for that you want to get a METAR
(weather) information.
For the example above: To get the METAR info from EDDF (Frankfurt/Main Germany)
you have to send DTMF-codes 2 and # after the module MetaInfo has been activated.
Search with google for an airport in your vicinity ( google: "ICAO Amsterdam" )

STARTDEFAULT=EDDP
You can predefine one ICAO-shortcut, for that MetarInfo is called automatically
if the module has been activated. Comment out if you don't want it.

LONGMESSAGES=1
If set to 1, it gives out e.g. "Ceiling and visibility OK" instead of just
"cavok". Comment out if you don't want it.
