 0.18.0 -- 14 May 2011
-----------------------

* The Async::AudioRecorder can now auto detect the file format from the
  filename extension.

* Improved audio device handling which makes it easier to add support for
  different kinds of audio subsystems.

* Added support for the ALSA audio subsystem.

* Bugfix in AudioFifo: The clear method did not work properly. Under some
  circumstances, allSamplesFlushed was not called which caused problems
  upstream.

* Bugfix in AudioDelayLine: Mute and clear did not do the right thing
  with the buffer pointer so it didn't behave properly.

* The AudioDelayLine now fade in and out when muting and clearing to
  avoid creating pops in the audio stream.



 0.17.0 -- 26 Apr 2009
-----------------------

* The Async internal sample rate is now configurable by a compile time
  define (INTERNAL_SAMPLE_RATE in makefile.cfg).

* Added the Async::AudioStreamStateDetector contributed by Steve / DH1DM.

* Implemented an audio codec framework that is meant to be used when
  streaming audio over a network.

* Bugfixes in Async::AudioPacer: Using a prebuf size of zero millisecods
  did not work. DH1DM: Fixed a buffer calculation error. Gaps could be
  introduced in some situations.

* Moved the audio recorder class from the SvxLink server application
  to Async (Async::AudioRecorder).

* The AudioRecorder can now write WAV files.

* Bugfix in AudioFilter: Filters was not properly created under som locales,
  like german (de_DE).



 0.16.1 -- 30 Jul 2008
-----------------------

* Bugfix and rewrite of the sound card code (AudioIO and AudioDevice classes).

* Bugfix and rewrite of the Async::AudioPacer class.

* Bugfix in Async::Timer: At destruction of a timer, a check was not made
  to see if it really existed.

* Bugfix in Async::CppDnsLookupWorker: The DNS code had a bug which showed
  itself under Ubuntu. A local variable was called "h_addr" which is defined
  in netdb.h as "h_addr_list[0]".



 0.16.0 -- 18 May 2008
-----------------------

* Lots of changes to adapt everything to the audio pipe infrastructure.

* Decreased buffers to improve audio latency.

* New method: AudioSplitter::enableSink make it possible to enable/disable
  branches in the splitter.

* Cleanup: Removed obsolete files and fixed files with wrong names.

* New method AudioFifo::enableBuffering: Use this method to enable/disable
  the buffering in the fifo. When disabled, this will effectively just make
  it a passthrough.

* Now possible to open left/right stereo channels as separate mono
  channels.

* Now possible to set sample rate, block size, channels and buffer size for
  a sound card.

* Made Async::CppDnsLookupWorker thread safe.



 0.15.0 -- 02 Jan 2008
-----------------------

* Now compile under CentOS 5.0, Fedora 8, Ubuntu 7.10 and Gentoo.

* Inserting repeated audio fragments if incoming audio pase is too slow.
  Good when using two sound cards with slightly different sampling rate.

* Fixes for 64 bit platforms.



 0.14.0 -- 15 Apr 2007
-----------------------

* Async::Config: Now possible to use the "open" method more than once to
  read multiple configuration files.

* It is now possible to read the sampling rate the audio device is using
  method Async::AudioIO::sampleRate.

* It is now possible to set the gain to use on an audio stream.

* New method: TcpConnection::isConnected.

* Now using float instead of short int to represent samples. This make it
  easier to apply audio processing on them.

* Created a new audio-lib where all the audio related classes have been put.

* A lot of new audio handling classes have been added.

* Now using libsigc++ version 1.2 instead of the old and outdated 1.0.

* ASYNC_AUDIO_NOTRIGGER=1 is now the default.



 0.13.0 -- 02 Dec 2005
-----------------------

* Merged Serial::InPin and Serial::OutPin to a new typedef Serial::Pin.
  Also added PIN_NONE.

* Bugfix in Config: It was not possible to specify an empty configuration
  variable using "".

* Fixed the makefile problem where it was not possible to compile SvxLink
  when a previous "make install" had been done. It tried to link against
  the installed libraries instead of the ones just compiled.



 0.12.1 -- 09 Oct 2005
-----------------------

* Bugfix in Async::TcpClient: In some situations sockets could be leaked
  and functions could be called twice instead of once. This may have caused
  crashes.



 0.12.0 -- 14 Aug 2005
-----------------------

* Bugfixes for multi open of sound device.

* New method in AudioIO to clear all samples in the buffer.

* Bugfix: Handling flushing when already flushed correctly.

* Bugfix: CPU could go up to 100% when writing audio to the
  sound card.

* DNS lookups are now asynchronous (well, threaded anyway)
  so no more blocking DNS lookup calls.

* Start and end of sound playback is now amplitude shaped
  to not create noise at end of playback.

* Bugfix: Forgot to clean up everything when the
  Async::TcpClient::disconnect method was called.

* Added an unequality operator to the Async::IpAddress class.



 0.11.0 -- 25 Mar 2005
-----------------------

* Added some code to AsyncTcpServer to broadcast data to connected
  clients. Contribution by SM0LCB / Ulf.

* Now possible to list all tags in a config section.

* The Serial class can now handle multiple users per port.

* Bugfix: The AudioIO class did not handle mutiple users correctly.



 0.10.0 -- 26 Sep 2004
----------------------

* Now the AudioIO object is really checking for full duplex capablility.

* Bugfix: The application would crash if the AudioIO object were deleted
  and then recreated.

* New class "Serial" for serial port usage.

* Bugfix: The DnsLookup class did not delete its DnsLookupWorker object
  and other memory handling was a mess as well. Thank you "valgrind"
  for helping me find this!



 0.9.0 -- 27 May 2004
----------------------

* Separate reader and writer in the same application can now open the audio
  device at the same time. The device is automatically set to full duplex
  operation. Previously, only one AudioIO object could have the device opened
  at a time.

* Added an environment variable that make it possible to disable the use
  of the trigger functionality when opening an audio device. This was necessary
  to make Alsa OSS emulation work. Set ASYNC_AUDIO_NOTRIGGER=1 to disable the
  use of the trigger functionality.

* Decreased the audio buffers in the audio device to make audio playback
  more responsive.



 0.8.0 -- 04 Apr 2004
----------------------

* Audio handling rewritten to handle a separate reader and writer within
  the same application.

* Split the async lib into core, cpp, qt and demo parts.

* Earlier log entries for the async library can be found in ../qtel/ChangeLog.
