 0.14.0 -- 14 May 2011
-----------------------

* Bugfix: When receiving multiple bye packets, the disconnection was
  announced multiple times.

* Added Speex codec support to EchoLink connections. This only work
  between two SvxLink nodes (or Qtel) at the moment.



 0.13.1 -- 26 Apr 2009
-----------------------

* Cleanup by DH1DM / Steve.



 0.13.0 -- 18 May 2008
-----------------------

* Changes to adapt the internal audio infrastructure to the audio pipe
  concept.



 0.12.1 -- 02 Jan 2008
-----------------------

* Fixes for 64 bit platforms.

* Fixed some warnings that appeared with gcc 4.2.



 0.12.0 -- 15 Apr 2007
-----------------------

* Now not possible to send audio/info/chat packets while not connected.
  Also, incoming audio/info/chat packets are thrown away when not connected.

* New method: Qso::currentState.

* Now using libsigc++ version 1.2 instead of the old and outdated 1.0.

* Bugfix: The Dispatcher object instance variable was not cleared when
  the dispatcher object was deleted.



 0.11.0 -- 02 Dec 2005
-----------------------

* Now possible to search for stations using only digits. All letters are
  mapped to a digit in the same way as they are mapped on many phones:
  ABC=2, DEF=3, GHI=4, JKL=5, MNO=6, PQRS=7, TUV=8, WXYZ=9. All other
  characters are mapped to digit 1.



 0.10.2 -- 09 Oct 2005
-----------------------

* Bugfix in EchoLib::Directory: Fixed the "Unexpected reply from directory
  server" bug.



 0.10.1 -- 14 Aug 2005
-----------------------

* Bugfix: There was no timeout on commands sent to the directory server.
  This caused hanging connections when the directory server did not
  answer properly. The timeout is now two minutes.

* Bugfix: The callsign was not converted to upper case in
  EchoLink::Directory::setLocalCallsign as it should.

* Now converting the callsign to upper case i EchoLink::Qso::setCallsign.



 0.10.0 -- 25 Mar 2005
----------------------

* Fixed a compilation error which occured with newer compilers. The
  declaration of class Qso::GsmVoicePacket was not standards compliant.

* Fixed a memory leak. The GSM codec instance was not destroyed when the
  Qso object was destroyed.

* Instead of crashing (assert) when the registration of a connection fails
  we now return an error.

* Added getters for localCallsign, localName and localInfo.



 0.9.0 -- 26 Sep 2004
----------------------

* Bugfix: Server messages was not handled correctly.

* Fixed a strange error message.

* The getCalls method now emits the error signal when the status is not
  ONLINE or BUSY.

* Added the possibility to send and receive raw GSM audio packets. This is
  good for forwarding audio in for example a conference node.

* Bugfix: The wanted directory status was used in some places where the
  current directory status (the true status) should be used.



 0.8.0 -- 27 May 2004
----------------------

* Now able to use an unmodified GSM library include file.

* New method: isRemoteInitiated.

* Made the RX indicator a bit snappier.

----------------------

* Look for earlier ChangeLog entries in ../qtel/ChangeLog.

* Adapted for changes in the async library.
