@brief	A class that implements the PTT controller
@author Tobias Blomberg
@date   2008-07-17

This class handle the triggering of the PTT for LocalTx. It can operate in
three different modes: OFF, ON or AUTO. The first two are obvious. In AUTO
mode, the PTT is triggered as long as there are incoming audio.

This class also implements the TX delay feature.
