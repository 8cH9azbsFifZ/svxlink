qtel \- a "QT EchoLink" client
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Qtel stands for the "QT EchoLink" client. It is only a EchoLink client application.
There is no "sysop mode". If it is a link you want to run, have a look at the SvxLink
server application. Qtel is quite a simple application, so most things should be self
explainatory. There are three windows: the main window, the communications dialog
and the settings dialog.
.
.PP
.B The Qtel Main Window
.PP
The main window consists of four areas. The top-left is where to choose which class of
staions to view (Conferences, Links, Repeaters and private Stations). All stations in
a class is shown to the top-right. At left-bottom is a message area that shows the messages
from the EchoLink directory server. At right-bottom is a list of incoming connections. To
accept an incoming connection, highligt the station and press "Accept".
.
.PP
.B The Qtel Communications Dialog
.PP
The communications dialog is used to perform a Qso to anoher station. To activate it,
double-click on a station line or just press the enter key when the station is highlighted.
To connect to the station, press the Connect button. To transmit, press the PTT button.
To disconnect, press the "Disconnect" button. In the big, white area in the middle of the
window, info messages from the remote station are shown. Chat messages from the
remote station is also shown here. In the oneline white area below, chat messages can be
typed that is sent to the remote station.
.
.PP
.B The Qtel Settings Dialog
.PP
The configuration dialog is brought up the first time the application is started.
Most fields are self explainatory. Location is the short string that is shown in
the EchoLink directory server listing. The info message is the one that is sent to the
remote station upon connection. In the Directory Server tab are some settings for the EchoLink directory
server connection.
